# **The Intersection of Drinking Water Quality and Environmental (In)Justice in Montréal, QC**.

#### *<center>By Sara Fraser Härstedt</center>*

**Hey! Welcome to my Term Project:)**

In this project, I am using water quality data from the Quebec's official website to visually display the boroughs of Montreal's water condtion based on two variables:
- The amount of bad/very bad pipes recorded
- Possible lead occurance in drinking water

Additionally, to add more depth, I am using population and visible minority data from CHASS in order to see if I can find a correlation between poor drinking water quality and areas of higher visible minority-percentage. 

The project walks the reader through code functions, shows statistical maps as well as answers two research questions:
- *What is the current state of water quality in Montreal, and how does it vary across different neighborhoods or regions?* 
- *Are there disparities in access to clean water based on socioeconomic factors such as visible minorities in Montreal?* 
 
I hope it brings some clarity.
